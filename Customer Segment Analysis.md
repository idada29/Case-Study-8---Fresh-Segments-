## Question 1
*Which interests have been present in all month_year dates in our dataset?Using our filtered dataset by removing the interests with less than 6 months worth of data, which are the top 10 and bottom 10 interests which have the largest composition values in any month_year? Only use the maximum composition value for each interest but you must keep the corresponding month_year*

 ```sql
  
WITH Composition_Ranking AS (
SELECT
	B.Month_Year,
    A.interest_name,
    any_value(B.composition) AS Composition,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY A.interest_name ORDER BY any_value(B.composition) DESC) AS interest_rank
  FROM
    interest_metrics B
  JOIN interest_map A 
  ON A.id = B.interest_id
  WHERE B.interest_id != 0 AND B.Month_Year > 6
  GROUP BY
    1,2
),
  
-- Select the top 10 interests by composition
TOP_10 AS(
SELECT 
	Month_Year, Interest_name, Composition
FROM Composition_Ranking
WHERE interest_rank = 1
ORDER BY Composition DESC
LIMIT 10),
  
-- Select the bottom 10 interests by composition
BOTTOM_10 AS(
	SELECT 
		Month_Year, Interest_name, Composition
	FROM Composition_Ranking
	WHERE interest_rank = 1
	ORDER BY Composition ASC
	LIMIT 10)

-- Combine the top and bottom 10 interests and order them by composition
SELECT * FROM TOP_10
UNION 
SELECT * FROM BOTTOM_10
ORDER BY Composition DESC;
  
```
