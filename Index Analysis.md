## Question 1
*What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?*

 ```sql
 WITH cte as 
  (SELECT 
    C.interest_name,
	  B.Month_Year,
	  B.composition / B.index_value AS index_composition,
    RANK() OVER ( PARTITION BY B.Month_Year ORDER BY B.composition / B.index_value DESC) AS index_rank
FROM  interest_metrics B
INNER JOIN interest_map C
ON B.interest_id = C.id 
WHERE B.Month_Year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY B.Month_Year)

SELECT *
FROM CTE
WHERE index_rank <= 10;

```

## Question 2
*For all of these top 10 interests - which interest appears the most often?*
 
 ```sql 
WITH cte as (SELECT 
    C.interest_name,
	B.Month_Year,
	ROUND(B.composition / B.index_value,2) AS index_composition,
    RANK() OVER ( PARTITION BY B.Month_Year ORDER BY ROUND(B.composition / B.index_value,2) DESC) AS index_rank
FROM  interest_metrics B
INNER JOIN interest_map C
ON B.interest_id = C.id 
WHERE B.Month_Year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY B.Month_Year)

SELECT 
    interest_name, COUNT(*) AS most_loved
FROM
    CTE
WHERE
    index_rank <= 10
GROUP BY interest_name
ORDER BY most_loved DESC
LIMIT 10;

```
interest_name                            | most_loved

 ## Question 3
*What is the average of the average composition for the top 10 interests for each month?*

 ```sql
WITH cte as (SELECT 
    C.interest_name,
	B.Month_Year,
	ROUND(B.composition / B.index_value,2) AS index_composition,
    RANK() OVER ( PARTITION BY B.Month_Year ORDER BY ROUND(B.composition / B.index_value,2) DESC) AS index_rank
FROM  interest_metrics B
INNER JOIN interest_map C
ON B.interest_id = C.id 
WHERE B.Month_Year IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY B.Month_Year)

SELECT 
    Month_Year, ROUND(AVG(index_composition),2) AS Avg_composition
FROM
    CTE
WHERE
    index_rank <= 10
GROUP BY Month_Year
ORDER BY Month_Year ASC;
 ```

|----------- | ----------------|
2018-07-01  |  6.04
2018-08-01  |  5.94

## Question 4
*What is the 3 month rolling average of the max average composition value from September 2018 to August 2019 and include the previous top ranking interests in the same output shown below.*

```sql
WITH Monthly_Interest as (
    SELECT 
        C.interest_name AS interest_name,
        B.Month_Year,
        ROUND(B.composition / B.index_value,2) AS index_composition,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY B.Month_Year ORDER BY ROUND(B.composition / B.index_value,2) DESC) AS index_rank
    FROM interest_metrics B
    INNER JOIN interest_map C ON B.interest_id = C.id 
    WHERE B.Month_Year IS NOT NULL

        interest_name,
        MAX(index_composition) AS max_index_composition,
        ROUND(AVG(index_composition) OVER (ORDER BY month_year ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS `3_month_moving_avg`,
		CONCAT(LAG(interest_name) OVER (ORDER BY month_year), ': ', LAG(index_composition) OVER (ORDER BY month_year)) AS `1_month_ago`,
        CONCAT(LAG(interest_name) OVER (ORDER BY month_year), ': ', LAG(index_composition,2) OVER (ORDER BY month_year)) AS `2_months_ago`
    FROM Monthly_Interest
    WHERE index_rank = 1
    GROUP BY month_year, interest_name,index_composition
)

## Question 5
*Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month to month? Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?*
